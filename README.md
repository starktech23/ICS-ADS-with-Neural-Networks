# ICS-ADS-with-Neural-Networks

This project is part of my summer internship at IIT Kanpur

Abstract: Industrial plants like water treatment plants, thermal power plants, Nuclear power plants and many more like these are critical Infrastructures for the country. These plants are prone to cyber attacks as the process control systems are becoming automated with help of SCADA(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ) and DCS(Distributed Control Systems) now a days as every command about the operation of the plant and the communication between the field Instruments like valves, sensor(level,temperature) and actuators are done using SCADA by networking them with each other with the help of special protocols like MODBUS TCP/IP. Zone Division helps us to divide the operation of the plants into plural zones having common security requirements and controls.My project will simulate a complex CPS model with the help of Python language and then collect data about working of the plant and train a ADS neural network to make it understand how normal plant works , then I will induce data injection attacks and analyse the behaviour  of neural network between the normal operation and abnormal operation.
